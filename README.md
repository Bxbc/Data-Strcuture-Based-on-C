# Data-Strcuture-Based-on-C-
Some basic implementation abount the data structure like linked list,tree and so on

## Note
Some according to the textbook, some written by myself. And the content now does not contain all the implementation about
basical data structure and I would complete it and add more in future. 

## Why use C
Because I think the C is a good language to help you to understand why we create these data structure in programming and which
way we use them to improve our efficiency. And in some "smarter" language like Java and python, these data stcuctures have been
created and included in their package or class, you can see them in source code. But here, the C is a good starting language 
for you to see deeper and think more about these structure.
